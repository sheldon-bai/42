7 invalid cases:
col = i % 5
row = i / 5
1. if col < 4 && buf[i] != # && buf[i] != '.'
2. if col == 4 && buf[i] != '\n'
3. ht_cnt != 4
3. ht_cnt(hash tag count) > 4
4. ht_cnt < 4 at the end
5. nb_cnt(neighbro count) != 6 && nb_cnt != 8
6. ret != 20 && ret != 21
7. ret == 21, but buf[20] != '\n'
8. fd == -1 e.g. input file name doesn't exist
9. argc != 2

10. The worst case test is 19 ‘-’, since the initial capsize is 9, but the solution capsize is 12 which results 3 level difference
